# ARC
Adaptive Research by Constraints

# This is a self teaching method for developers :
To be productive imidiatly for professional projects with new or innovative technologies.

#### What ARC means ?
ARC(Adaptive Research by Constraints) is a method of work that indentifies the constraints related to a project or a mission and research an adaptive solution.

### Simple explanation what is an ARC Expert :
- Someone who has learned to change wheels for cars is what we called an expert in his domain.
- Someone who has learned how to learn and can change wheels but also can adapt if the cars changes to flying cars is what we are calling an ARC expert. He/she adapts to the constraints

# How to become an ARC Expert in IT

## Prerequisites

To become an ARC Expert you need to have some algorithmic basics or development. You will need to learn and master ```linux cmds``` (http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php).

A Perefect way of doing this is to learn a low level program laguage such as C (main choice of universities or IT schools).
You need to understand how simple functions work in C such as strlen, Printf, malloc and others...

To do so a good excercise is to rebuild most of the C libraries or even develop simple programs without the C library.

### You will have to use only write and read method in C :

C libraries are forbiden for you now

*You need to understand that computering is all about read and write !*

```
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void)
{
  char c = 'A';
  write(0, &c, 1);
  return 1;
}
```

and

```
char *buffer;
read(0, buffer, 1);
```

TIP: RTFM (Read the fucking manual) use man [name of the function] in your prompt ```(ex: man strlen)```

*In france schools such as ```Epitech``` and ```42``` have mastered this knowledge and propose a good cursus to learn with these methodologies.*

## RPC Protocols

RPC Protocols are common usage of code to help communication.
You can have a look at FTP (File Transfer Protocol) or SMTP (email) RPC and try to code it in C or C++.
This will show you how communication works.

## Parallel programmation

Don't forget of course to have a look at Forks and Threads if you are interseted into low level programmation.

## See how framework and other languages works

Pick up a modern language of your choice and chose a framework to code a small program.

*Did you noticed similarities ? It's normal you have the basics now*

# How to learn to learn ?

Programmation is not something that can be learned it is evovling continuously and you will have to learn continuously as well, that's how ARC was borned.

You will need to become stuborn and focus on what you are searchnig. The ARC method is base on focusing on the constraint and only on the constraint. If you are using a new language or technology you will need to focus on the how to solve your problem. Do not search for something unrelated to gain experience on the technology or language.

- The key here is to be productive and be fast !

You have acquired the basics and the common knowledge with the "Prerequisites", so don't waste your time acknowledging things that are not necessary for you current constraint or problem.

### How to search for the solution

Is it language, library, framework, API or other related constraint ?

- You will have to look first into the technical manuals and documentations, they have literally build the project they know how to do.

- When you know how to apply the solution to your problem look for an easier way on the internet, yes I am speaking about google. You will need to find if there is an adaptive solution to your problem. The goal here is to not re-invent the wheel.

*Search with the keywords of your curent Technology (ex: websockets node.js)*

- You can look also if there is an open-source solution on guthub or on stackoverflow for exemple.

- If you are not certain which metod is the best you will have to search which is the most adaptive solution to your problem. Then Youtube is also a good way to find suggestions on problematics and solutions.

*if you found a new solution that is not on present on the internet add it on your github. You will have suggestions on your code and you will help others like you.*

# Practice again, and again

You will have to practice a lot before being able to claim yourself an ARC Expert. It takes time to be a good self learner.

### How about copy / paste ?

There is no rules to this, you can copy / paste code to go faster. But there is one fondamental strategy on the copy / paste. You have to understand what the copy / paste code does and how it is working, in order to avoid related problems and constrains when you want to make it evolve.

# Work in Team with the ARC method:

Teamwork is essential for programmation, you will need to interact with other developers. The ARC method allow you to ask only the smart or necessary questions to your team. The rest of the knowledge must be learned by yourself. Don't make them loose their time.

```
Important: Keep your code commented or/and a good documentation to help them work on your project.

# But how to innovate and get better ?

When you are working you have to focus and deliver your adaptive solutions really fast.

There will always be time for you on weekends or from home to discover and innovate by testing new technologies.

Stay alert on the market and what is new !
